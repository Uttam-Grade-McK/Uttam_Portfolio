* Task-3:
# [Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.](https://github.com/uttamgrade/The_Spark_Foundation.git) 
* In this project, I build a Decision-Tree Classifier model to predict the Species of the Iris dataset. I build two models, one with criterion gini index and another one with criterion entropy. The model yields a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy in both the cases.

* In the model with criterion gini index, the training-set accuracy score is 0.9524 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.9778. These two values are quite comparable. So, there is no sign of overfitting.

* In both the cases, the training-set and test-set accuracy score is the same. It may happen because of small dataset. The confusion matrix and classification report yields very good model performance.
